Create a Frontend CLI: A Dynamic Boilerplate for React, Redux and Tailwind with Hygen

## Introduction

Initializing a new project from scratch with all the dependencies and configurations takes a lot of effort and time. This is especially challenging if you work in a company where a number of projects are growing with the same configs and technical stack, it pulls you back with different versions of dependencies, repetitive tasks and misleading to use different configs and probably leading to divergence from the unified stack. To overcome all of these drawbacks, I recommend using a code generator such as Hygen. Hygen can help you simplify the process by automating the creation of boilerplate code. This article will guide you through the establishment of a Hygen generator to set up a new React project with Redux and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following setup:

- Node.js and npm
- Globally installation of Hygen `npm install -g hygen` or using `npx hygen â€¦` if you like a no-string-attached approach

## Run project

After clone this repo and install prerequisites, run command:

```bash
sh start.sh
```

It'll ask about project name and automatically will create a full configured frontend project.
